# 🌧️ Acid Rain Analysis & Prediction Across India

This project analyzes and predicts acid rain behavior (specifically **pH levels**) across different regions of India using air quality and chemical ion concentration data. The solution includes data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, machine learning modeling, and clustering to identify pollution hotspots and their correlation with acidic precipitation.

## 📂 Dataset Overview

- **Name:** `acid_rain_pan_india_cleaned.csv`
- **Size:** ~30,000+ records
- **Features Include:**
  - SO2, NOx, PM2.5, RSPM, SPM
  - pH levels (target variable)
  - Sulfate, Nitrate, Ammonium, Calcium, Chloride
  - TDS, Conductivity
  - Location, State, Season

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict the **pH level of rainfall** using pollutant concentrations.
- Identify which cities are **most affected** by acid rain precursors (SO2, NOx).
- Use **clustering** to detect geographical zones at high risk.
- Build **ML models** to quantify environmental damage potential.
